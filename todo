# first step
- create have 4 registers
- have simple commads for load from reg load value to reg
- add simple alu with addition
- have a carry flag
- write code to compile the asm and add it to the verilog
- run simple test program

- try to simulate before trying to use the fpga

modules:
top - top
gpr - global purpose registers
alu - addition operation
rom - holds the assembly
decoder - decodes each line in assembly
flags - carry flag for the addition
reset - reset using button ??
