LD - load value from one register to another
LD [to register], [from register]
```
LD R1, R2
R1 = R2
```

LDR - load value raw into register
LDR [to register], [value]
```
LDR R1, 10
R1 = 10
```
| add support for both int,hex,binary,char
| int - just number
| hex - start with 0x
| binary - start with b
| char - have ' around it

ADD - adds registers
ADD [to register], [with register]
```
ADD R1, R2
R1 = R1 + R2
```

SUB - substracks registers
SUB [to registers], [with registers]
```
SUB R1, R2
R1 = R1 - R2
```

INC - increments register by one
INC [register to increment]
```
INC R1
R1 = R1 + 1
```

DEC - decrement register by one
DEC [register to decrement]
```
DEC R1
R1 = R1 - 1
```

PSH - push register value on the stack
PSH [from register]
```
PSH R1
[R1 value is now on the stack and the pointer moved]
```

POP - pop last value from the stack to the register
POP [to register]
```
POP R1
[R1 value is the last value on the stack, pointer moves down]
```
